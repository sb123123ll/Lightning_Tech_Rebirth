# Electromagnetic Railgun

The **Electromagnetic Railgun** is a modular overload weapon. It requires a bound ME network for Lightning ammunition and a local FE buffer for charging and firing.

## Required Setup

Prepare the railgun at the <ItemLink id="ae2lt:overload_device_workbench" />:

* Install an <ItemLink id="ae2lt:ultimate_overload_core" /> in the structural core slot; this is required for railgun operation
* Install the <ItemLink id="ae2lt:railgun_module_core" /> to enable charged shots and HV compensation when EHV is short

The workbench binds the railgun to its ME network when the railgun is inserted. The bound network must stay loaded and online. Without an Energy Module, the railgun stores 1,000,000 FE.

## Fire Modes

### Beam Fire

Hold the attack key while the railgun is in the main hand to fire a beam with a base range of 64 blocks.

Beam fire uses High Voltage Lightning only. By default, each 2-tick settle deals 20 damage, ignores 40% of armor reduction, consumes 400 FE, and consumes 1 High Voltage Lightning every 8 settles.

### Charged Shot

Hold use to charge, then release to fire. Releasing before the first charge tier produces no shot. Charged shots have a base range of 64 blocks.

| Tier | Base Charge Time | Default Damage | Firing Cost |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| EHV1 | 0.5 s | 100 | 8,000 FE + 32 EHV |
| EHV2 | 1.2 s | 300 | 40,000 FE + 96 EHV |
| EHV3 | 2.0 s | 600 | 200,000 FE + 256 EHV |

Charging also drains FE from the railgun buffer each tick: 1,000 / 4,000 / 10,000 FE for EHV1 / EHV2 / EHV3 charge progress. Charged shots have 80% armor bypass, apply electromagnetic paralysis for 2 seconds, and gain 25% damage during thunderstorms when the shooter can see the sky.

If EHV ammunition is missing, the core module can automatically substitute High Voltage Lightning at a ratio of **16 HV = 1 EHV**.

## Recoil

Charged shots apply tier-based recoil; crouching halves it, while firing mid-air makes it stronger.

Wearing the complete Celestweave set (<ItemLink id="ae2lt:celestweave_oculus" />, <ItemLink id="ae2lt:celestweave_core" />, <ItemLink id="ae2lt:celestweave_conduit" />, <ItemLink id="ae2lt:celestweave_stride" />) cancels charged-shot recoil entirely, including the view kick and camera shake feedback.

## Modules

| Module | Limit | Effect |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Energy Module T1 / T2 / T3 | 1 | Sets railgun FE capacity to 100,000,000 / 500,000,000 / 2,000,000,000 FE |
| Overload Compute Module | 2 | Enables and improves chain arcs; at max charge, strengthens the EMP pulse |
| Overload Acceleration Module | 2 | Each module adds +1 charge unit per tick, reducing charge time; it also shortens the continuous beam's settle interval |
| Overload Range Module | 2 | Multiplies continuous-beam and charged-shot range: one module gives 2x range and two give 4x |
| Overload Execution Module | 1 | Triggers only on EHV3 charged hits; in an active execution mode it spends an additional 20,000,000 FE to record the target's health, and repeated hits can complete the execution |
| Multidimensional Execution Module | 1 | Replaces Overload Execution: an eligible EHV3 hit ignores the health threshold and the module's additional FE / Lightning cost; its exact result follows the shared Execution Method setting |

Without compute modules, chain arcs are disabled. With two acceleration modules, charge progress accumulates at three times the base rate.

Overload Execution and Multidimensional Execution occupy the same execution slot and cannot be installed together. The Multidimensional module removes the execution surcharge; charging and firing the railgun still use the ordinary shot costs listed above.

## Device Hub Settings

Open the Overload Device Hub with the default key G while holding the railgun.

* **Terrain Destruction** controls whether charged shots break terrain, ignoring claim protection. It is off by default and can still be disabled by server config
* **PVP** allows the railgun to damage other players when enabled. When disabled, players are not targeted or damaged
* **Sound** controls the railgun's local sound effects
* **Chain Damage** enables chain jumps for both charged shots and the continuous beam; the ordinary beam can start a chain at its endpoint even without a direct entity hit
* **Execution Method** is shared by both execution modules and cycles through Off, Normal Death and Forced Death. Off never enters the explicit death/removal chain: Overload Execution instead adds 600 armor-piercing electromagnetic damage, while Multidimensional Execution adds `Float.MAX_VALUE` armor-piercing electromagnetic damage. These ordinary damage calls preserve the target's own damage, death and loot mechanics. The Off fallback has no execution-module surcharge
* **Charged Splash** controls landing-point area damage for every charged tier; disabling it keeps direct hits and chains from directly hit targets
* **Overload Execution range** always includes the direct target, while local-area execution is limited to half of the active charged-splash radius; chain propagation never carries execution
* The hub also shows module counts, FE storage and bound network status

## Combat Notes

Charged shots deal splash damage at the impact point, with tier radii of 5.5 / 8 / 12 blocks; damage falls off toward the edge, and splash damage against players is halved. EHV3 also penetrates up to 5 targets and releases an EMP pulse with a 10-block radius around the first target.

Compute modules increase chain jump count and fork count, and enlarge the pulse radius while raising pulse damage. Thunderstorms increase chain reach and fork count.
