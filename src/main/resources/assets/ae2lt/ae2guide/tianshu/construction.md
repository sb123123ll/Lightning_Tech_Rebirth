# Structure and Auto-build

The Tianshu Supercomputing Array occupies a fixed **7×7×7** volume. Its controller sits at the center of the bottom edge of one side. From the controller, the structure extends six blocks forward, six blocks upward, and three blocks to either side.

The scene below shows one complete structure using a Tianshu Baseline Main Core. Drag to rotate the scene. The centers of the bottom and top faces are the two possible port positions.

## Auto-build Material List

These quantities assume that only the controller has been placed and every other target position is empty. Existing correct blocks are retained and deducted from the actual requirements.

| Material | Count | Auto-build Behavior |
|----------|------:|---------------------|
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_supercomputer_casing" /> | 99 | Fixed casing positions |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:phase_change_cooling_unit" /> | 17 | Fills the 16 fixed cooling positions and the unused port candidate by default; closed-loop storage may replace these blocks |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_supercomputer_glass" /> | 98 | Fixed core-chamber observation layer |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_supercomputer_port" /> | 1 | Placed in the lower candidate when no port already exists |

The controller is already present and is not consumed by the button. Auto-build also leaves the core chamber untouched. Formation requires the following units to be installed manually:

| Core-chamber Unit | Count | Requirement |
|-------------------|------:|-------------|
| Any Tianshu Main Core | 1 | Must occupy the exact chamber center |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_blank_unit" /> | 0–26 | Fills a peripheral cell without providing an attribute |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:storage_supercomputing_unit" /> | 0–25 | Optional; increases crafting storage for finite tiers |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:parallel_supercomputing_unit" /> | 0–26 | Baseline, Quantum, and Overload require at least one; Multidimensional rejects them |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_amplifier_unit" /> | 0–15 | Accepted only by Quantum and Overload |

These four computing-unit types fill the 26 non-center cells of the core chamber. Baseline rejects Amplifier Units; Quantum and Overload accept at most 15 and all three finite tiers require at least one Parallel Unit. Multidimensional accepts only Blank Units in its 26 peripheral cells. Closed-Loop Pattern Storage and Closed-Loop Seed Storage are not core-chamber units; they belong in the shell's cooling-compatible positions.

The shell has **17 cooling-compatible positions**: 16 fixed cooling positions plus whichever port candidate is not occupied by the Port. Each accepts a Phase-Change Cooling Unit, Closed-Loop Pattern Storage, or Closed-Loop Seed Storage. Auto-build treats a closed-loop storage block already installed in one of these positions as valid and leaves it in place.

In total, a complete structure built from an empty site uses **243 blocks**: 1 manually placed controller, 215 non-core blocks that auto-build can place (99 casings + 98 glass + 17 cooling-compatible positions + 1 port), and 27 manually installed core-chamber units. Replacing cooling-compatible positions with closed-loop storage reduces the number of Phase-Change Cooling Units required accordingly.

## Using Auto-build

1. Place the controller and reserve the full 7×7×7 volume in its facing direction
2. Put the casing, Phase-Change Cooling Units, glass, and port in the **player inventory**; closed-loop storage may be installed in cooling-compatible positions first
3. Open the controller and select **Auto-build Shell**
4. After shell construction finishes, install the Tianshu Main Core and 26 core-chamber Peripheral Units, then install closed-loop storage in cooling-compatible positions as needed

Auto-build reads only the player inventory; it does not extract blocks from the ME network or adjacent containers. It verifies the full material requirement before starting, then places one block per tick. Keep all required materials in the inventory until construction finishes.

An existing Port may occupy either candidate. If there is no Port, one candidate already contains a Phase-Change Cooling Unit or closed-loop storage, and the other is empty, auto-build keeps the existing block and places the Port in the empty position. If both candidates are empty, the lower position is used by default. If both contain non-Port blocks, clear one position first.

If any casing, cooling-compatible, glass, or port position handled by auto-build contains an incorrect block, auto-build places nothing. Clear the coordinates reported by the controller and try again. If materials are removed or a target becomes obstructed after construction starts, the process stops and consumes only blocks that were placed successfully.

## Manual Construction Rules

* Exactly **one** of the two port candidates must contain a Tianshu Port; the other accepts a Phase-Change Cooling Unit, Closed-Loop Pattern Storage, or Closed-Loop Seed Storage
* The chamber center requires one Tianshu Main Core, and Main Cores are invalid in the other 26 cells
* All 26 peripheral cells must contain Blank, Storage, Parallel, or Amplifier Units supported by the selected main core; closed-loop storage is invalid in the core chamber
* Baseline, Quantum, and Overload require at least one Parallel Unit; Storage Units are optional
* Baseline rejects Amplifier Units; Quantum and Overload accept at most 15
* Multidimensional accepts only Blank Units in the core chamber
* All 16 fixed cooling positions and the unused port candidate require a Phase-Change Cooling Unit or one of the two closed-loop storage blocks

The structure rescans and forms automatically after the final required block is placed.
