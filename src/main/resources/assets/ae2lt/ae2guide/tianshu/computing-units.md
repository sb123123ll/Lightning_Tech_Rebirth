# Main Cores, Computing Units, and Performance

The core chamber occupies the central 3×3×3 volume. Its exact center requires one Main Core, while the remaining 26 cells accept only Tianshu Blank, Storage, Parallel, or Amplifier Units. Closed-Loop Pattern Storage and Closed-Loop Seed Storage are installed in the shell's cooling-compatible positions, which share their placement rules with Phase-Change Cooling Units. The selected Main Core tier determines which combinations are valid. The scene below removes the shell to show the Main Core's central position.

## At a Glance

### Core Chamber and Units

The central 3×3×3 volume contains Storage, Parallel, Amplifier, and Tianshu Blank Units, with a Main Core fixed at the exact center.

Storage Units determine the CPU's crafting-storage capacity, like AE2 Crafting Storage.
Parallel Units provide dispatch parallelism, like AE2 Co-Processing Units.
Amplifier Units scale dispatch, external storage, and batch-copy capacity for supported cores; at most 15 may be installed.
Tianshu Blank Units are structural placeholders and provide no performance benefit.

> A Multidimensional Main Core accepts no functional peripheral units: all 26 surrounding cells must contain Tianshu Blank Units. A Baseline Main Core does not accept Amplifier Units.

All 27 cells in the central 3×3×3 volume must be filled for the structure to form. Higher-tier Main Cores provide higher limits; the table below is only a quick summary, with detailed formulas later on this page.

| Main Core | Internal Storage | Successful Dispatches/t Cap | Amplifier Units |
|-----------|-----------------:|----------------------------:|-----------------|
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_baseline_main_core" /> | 1 MiB | 512 | Unsupported |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_quantum_main_core" /> | 256 MiB | 6,144 | 0–15 |

| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_multidimensional_main_core" /> | Infinite | 16,384 | Unsupported |

### Shell Positions and Replacements

Each of the shell's 17 cooling-compatible positions accepts a Phase-Change Cooling Unit, Closed-Loop Pattern Storage, or Closed-Loop Seed Storage. Exactly one of the two port candidates must contain the Tianshu Port that connects the structure to the ME network; the other remains a cooling-compatible position.

## Main Cores

The Main Core provides internal crafting storage and sets the ceilings for the successful-dispatch and batch-copy budgets. Each of the three parameters governs one thing — crafting storage decides how many jobs can be held at once, successful dispatches decide how many machines can be put to work each tick, and batch copies decide how many executions a batch-capable target can take in a single call — and none can substitute for another.

| Main Core | Internal Storage | Successful Dispatches/t Cap | Maximum Copies/t | Amplifier Units |
|-----------|-----------------:|----------------------------:|-----------------:|-----------------|
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_baseline_main_core" /> | 1 MiB | 512 | 1,024 | Unsupported |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_quantum_main_core" /> | 256 MiB | 6,144 | 20,480 | 0–15 |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_overload_main_core" /> | 64 GiB | 16,384 | 4,194,304 | 0–15 |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_multidimensional_main_core" /> | Infinite | 16,384 | Infinite | Unsupported |

Baseline, Quantum, and Overload require at least one Parallel Unit; Storage Units are optional. Multidimensional uses only its main-core budget: its 26 peripheral cells cannot contain Storage, Parallel, or Amplifier Units and must all be filled with Blank Units.

## Performance Parameters

### Crafting Storage

Crafting storage holds crafting plans, intermediate results, and task state. Tianshu can run multiple crafting jobs at the same time. Each job reserves its required bytes when it starts and releases them when it completes or is cancelled.

Storage determines whether a job can be accepted and how many jobs can remain active. It does not increase pattern dispatch speed or reduce machine processing time.

### Successful Dispatches

A successful dispatch is one pattern dispatch per tick actually accepted by a Pattern Provider; it directly determines how many processing machines Tianshu can put to work each tick. The parallelism shown in the crafting confirmation screen's CPU selection list comes from this parameter and excludes the batch-copy budget described below.

A larger dispatch budget never makes an individual machine work faster. When providers, machines, materials, or network transfer capacity run short, rejected dispatch calls do not count as successful dispatches, and the surplus budget simply sits idle.

### Batch Copies

One copy means one execution of a pattern recipe. The batch-copy budget limits the total number of pattern executions that compatible execution paths can submit per tick. For example, one provider call that submits 32 executions of the same pattern consumes one successful dispatch and 32 copies.

Batch copies do not duplicate items: every execution still consumes inputs, energy, processing time, and output space exactly as the pattern declares.

**Ordinary processing machines accept only one copy per call**: for them, throughput is entirely determined by successful dispatches, and surplus copy budget is not converted into additional dispatches. The only targets that accept multiple copies at once — and therefore actually use the copy budget — are Molecular Assembler-compatible crafting patterns, the Tianshu Matter Warping Matrix, supported closed-loop patterns, and other devices that explicitly support batch execution.

## Unit Counts and Formulas

Let **S**, **P**, and **A** be the counts of Storage, Parallel, and Amplifier Units. Each Storage Unit supplies 64 MiB of external storage, and each Parallel Unit supplies 128 points of base dispatch capacity. Finite tiers require `P ≥ 1`; Quantum and Overload also require `0 ≤ A ≤ 15`.

| Main Core | Dispatch Gain | External-storage Gain | Copy Gain per Successful Dispatch |
|-----------|--------------:|----------------------:|----------------------------------:|
| Baseline | ×1 | ×1 | ×2 |
| Quantum | `×2(1+A)` | `×2(1+A)` | `×(1+A)` |
| Overload | `×2(1+A)` | `×[2(1+A)]²` | `×(1+A)²` |

The resulting parameters are calculated as follows:

* Successful dispatches equal `128 × P × dispatch gain`, capped by the Main Core.
* Total crafting storage equals the internal storage plus `64 MiB × S × external-storage gain`.
* Maximum copies equal successful dispatches times the copy gain, capped by the Main Core's copy ceiling.

For example, a Quantum core with 20 Parallel Units, 5 Amplifier Units, and 1 Storage Unit: the dispatch gain is ×12, so the formula gives `128 × 20 × 12 = 30,720` dispatches, capped at **6,144** by the Quantum ceiling; external storage is `64 MiB × 1 × 12 = 768 MiB`, giving **1 GiB** with the 256 MiB internal storage; the copy gain is ×6, so the formula gives `6,144 × 6 = 36,864` copies, capped at **20,480**. The controller screen indicates when a parameter has reached its cap.

To illustrate how the two budgets relate, consider a configuration with 512 successful dispatches and 1,024 maximum copies per tick: sending only single-copy patterns uses at most 512 of those copies per tick, while batch-capable targets can combine multiple executions of the same pattern within the same 512 accepted calls and use the full 1,024 copies. The provider and the target machine determine the actual grouping; a single machine is not guaranteed to accept the complete budget.

## Configuration Guidance

* **Jobs rejected for insufficient capacity:** Add Storage Units or switch to a higher-tier Main Core
* **Plenty of providers and machines but too few working at once:** Add Parallel Units; Quantum and Overload cores can also add Amplifier Units
* **Amplifier Units scale dispatch, external storage, and batch copies simultaneously** and are the main lever for Quantum and Overload cores; note that any formula result beyond the Main Core's cap is wasted
* **Multidimensional** provides every parameter from the main core itself; simply fill the periphery with Blank Units — no ratios to balance

## Amplifier, Blank, and Closed-Loop Storage

The <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_amplifier_unit" /> increases dispatch, external-storage, and batch-copy capacity for Quantum and Overload cores. Baseline and Multidimensional reject Amplifier Units; Quantum and Overload accept at most 15.

The <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_blank_unit" /> is the neutral placeholder shared by the Tianshu Supercomputing Array and Tianshu Matter Warping Matrix. It keeps a peripheral cell structurally valid but contributes no crafting storage, dispatch capacity, amplification, pattern slots, or seed capacity.

Closed-loop analysis and execution are built into the Main Core and require no separate closed-loop compute core. Closed-Loop Pattern Storage and Closed-Loop Seed Storage remain external physical storage installed in the shell's cooling-compatible positions, where each replaces a Phase-Change Cooling Unit. They provide pattern capacity or seed storage but do not occupy the 26 core-chamber peripheral cells and do not count toward **S**, **P**, or **A**. Use Blank Units for core-chamber cells that need no compute attribute.

Closed-Loop Seed Storage contains 10 cell slots and can hold seeds only after an **ME Storage Cell** compatible with the seed type is installed. Players cannot place seed items directly into these slots. Open the closed-loop page of the Tianshu Pattern Encoding Terminal and select **Refill Seeds** to transfer seeds automatically from the current ME network. If the terminal reports that seed storage cannot accept items, check for installed cells, free bytes, type capacity, and cell partitions.
