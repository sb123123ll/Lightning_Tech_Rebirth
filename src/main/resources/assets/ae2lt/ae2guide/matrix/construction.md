# Structure and Auto-build

The matrix occupies a fixed **7×11×7** volume. The Controller is centered on one 7×11 side. The structure extends 6 blocks in the Controller's facing direction, 3 blocks to either side, and 5 blocks both above and below it.

The scene below shows a complete formable structure with the minimum pattern capacity, a Stable Main Core, one T1 Thread Unit, and 79 Tianshu Blank Units. Drag to rotate it. The annotations identify the Controller, default Port position, and one Pattern Storage.

## Quick Reference

The Controller's use page in JEI (`U` by default) can encode a pattern for the material list with one click.

### Minimum Configuration Materials

The following blocks are placed by auto-build:

| Material | Count |
|----------|------:|
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_casing" /> | 174 |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_constraint_frame" /> | 132 |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_glass" /> | 44 |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_port" /> | 1 |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_pattern_storage_t1" /> or <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_pattern_storage_t2" /> | 1–50 |

The minimum manual core configuration is:

| Material | Count |
|----------|------:|
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:tianshu_blank_unit" /> | 79 |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_stable_main_core" /> | 1 |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_thread_unit_t1" /> | 1 |

The Main Core must occupy the center of the structure.

## Auto-build Material List

These quantities apply when only the Controller has been placed and every other target position is empty. Existing valid blocks are preserved and deducted from the actual requirement.

| Material | Count | Auto-build behavior |
|----------|------:|---------------------|
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_casing" /> | 174 | Fixed outer casing |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_constraint_frame" /> | 132 | Includes the two Port candidates not used by the Port |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_glass" /> | 44 | Fixed observation layer |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_port" /> | 1 | Placed opposite the Controller unless a Port already exists |
| <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_pattern_storage_t1" /> or <ItemLink id="ae2lt:matter_warping_matrix_pattern_storage_t2" /> | 1–50 | At least 1 is required; additional storages in the player inventory are inserted into empty bays, up to 50 |

The Controller is already in the world and is not consumed by the button. A complete structure also requires the following manually placed components:

| Internal core | Count | Notes |
|---------------|------:|-------|
| Any main core | 1 | Must occupy the geometric center |
| Peripheral units | 80 | Every peripheral position must be filled; finite Main Cores require at least one Thread Unit, so the minimum is one T1 Thread Unit and 79 Tianshu Blank Units |

Starting from an empty site therefore requires at minimum **1 Controller, 352 structure blocks placed by the button, 1 Main Core, and 80 Peripheral Units**. The 352 structure blocks already include one minimum-required Pattern Storage.

## Using Auto-build

1. Place the Controller and reserve the full volume in its facing direction
2. Put the Casings, Frames, Glass, Port, and desired Pattern Storages in the **player inventory**
3. Use **Auto-build** from the Controller
4. After auto-build completes, manually place one Main Core and 80 Peripheral Units in the central core chamber

Auto-build only reads the player inventory. It cannot extract blocks from the ME network or adjacent containers. If only one Pattern Storage is wanted, do not carry additional Matrix Pattern Storages while using the button.

If any Casing, Frame, Glass, Port candidate, or Pattern Storage bay contains an invalid block, auto-build places nothing. Clear the blocked target position and try again.

## Manual Formation Rules

* Exactly **one** of the three Port candidates must contain a Matrix Port; the other two must be Constraint Frames
* The 50 Pattern Storage bays may be empty or contain T1/T2 storages, but at least one storage is required
* None of the 81 core positions may be empty: the center must be a Main Core and all other positions must be Peripheral Units
* Stable, Quantum, and Overload Main Cores require at least one Thread Unit; Quantum and Overload allow at most 15 Tianshu Amplifier Units; Stable rejects amplifiers, while Multidimensional only accepts Tianshu Blank Units
* Open gaps shown by the structure are not structure members and do not need to be sealed

When the final required block is placed, the matrix rescans and forms automatically. The Auto-build button does not need to be pressed again.
